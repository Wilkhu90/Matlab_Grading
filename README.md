# Matlab_Grading
The script is using Node.js to setup the Matlab Lab files for grading - COMP 1200.

# Steps to prepare files are as followed:

1) Clone this repository in your system.

2) Make sure you have node.js install in your system. You can check that by using terminal/command line. Just type **node -v** and you should see the version of node.js.

3) After making sure of node.js, just type cd path/to/the/repository and go to the folder that you cloned.

4) Now, type npm install in terminal and your dependencies will be installed.

5) Once, the setup is finished, you're ready to use the service. Just copy the "LAB0X_submissions.zip" in this folder and type node index.js LAB0X_submissions.zip and the files would be extracted automatically. Also, in case you have a text file to be copied, then you can type node index.js LAB0X_submissions.zip auburnScore.txt.

6) That's it.
